# Seniority Is Earned in Incidents, Not Interviews

Interviews test knowledge.
Production incidents test judgment.

Real engineering maturity is built when:

- A deployment fails under load
- A slow query locks the database
- Cache invalidation breaks data consistency
- One service failure cascades into another
- Logs start flooding and users are impacted

During incidents, senior engineers:

1. Stay calm under pressure
2. Communicate clearly with stakeholders
3. Identify blast radius quickly
4. Roll back or mitigate fast
5. Perform root cause analysis
6. Add preventive guardrails

Technical knowledge is important.
But ownership, judgment, and prevention mindset define seniority.

## Lessons from Production Incidents

- Design for failure, not perfection
- Always monitor what you deploy
- Optimize observability before optimization
- Prefer simplicity over cleverness
- Document learnings after every incident

Production pain builds depth.
