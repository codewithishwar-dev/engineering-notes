# Edge Cases First Thinking

Most solutions work for the happy path.

Strong engineers test edge cases first.

## Common Edge Cases

- Empty input
- Single element
- Maximum constraints
- Duplicate values
- Unexpected format
- Null / undefined inputs

## Why This Matters

Production rarely fails on normal input.

It fails on the one scenario nobody tested.

## Practical Rule

Before coding the full solution:

1. Write down 3 edge cases.
2. Try solving the smallest possible input.
3. Try the largest possible input.
4. Think about invalid data.

## Engineering Insight

Experience is not about writing more code.
It’s about predicting failure earlier.
